# Semantic-Segmentation
In this project we carry out a semantic segmentation work for a dataset of images based on daily situations on a highway, taken from a camera. We rely on TensorFlow to build our training network.

# CamSeq 2007
101 image pairs for semantic segmentation from the University of Cambridge

## About Dataset
N.B. The owner of this Dataset is The University of Cambridge (2007).
I'm not in any way affiliated with The University of Cambridge. I just thought it would be nice for people to have this dataset available on Kaggle.

Context

CamSeq01 is a groundtruth dataset that can be freely used for research work in object recognition in video.

Content

This dataset contains 101 960x720 pixel image pairs. Every mask is designated by an "_L" addition to the file name. All images (original and groundtruth) are in uncompressed 24-bit color PNG format.
